# Plugin Marketplace

VS Code-style extension marketplace for BPLC STA Monitor.
Source: `src/plugin/market/` (`plugin_market.*` backend, `market_dialog.*` UI).

## Market feed

`market.json` (see `BPLC_Plugin_Market` repo):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "plugins": [{
    "name": "js-topo",
    "display_name": "...", "display_name_en": "...",
    "description": "...",  "description_en": "...",
    "category": "diagnosis | report | graphics | protocol",
    "author": "bplc",
    "readme_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../readme/js-topo.md",
    "versions": [{
      "version": "1.1.0",
      "url": "https://.../js-topo-1.1.0.zip",
      "sha256": "<hex>",
      "size": 2400,
      "min_app_version": "1.3.0",
      "updated_at": "2026-10-02",
      "platforms": ["linux-x86_64"]
    }]
  }]
}
```

- `readme_url`: README markdown rendered in the dialog's *README* tab
  (markdown via `QTextDocument`). For installed plugins the dialog prefers
  `<plugin-dir>/README.md` shipped inside the package, then falls back to
  this URL, then to the plain description.
- `updated_at`: per-version update date (ISO), shown as 更新时间/Updated.
- `platforms`: optional list of platform IDs this version supports
  (`linux-x86_64`, `windows-x86_64`, `macos-arm64`, `macos-x86_64`).
  Absent or empty = all platforms (script plugins). The client only
  offers/installs the newest version compatible with the running
  platform, shows the platform list in the detail panel, and hides
  market entries that have no compatible version at all. The plugin
  count reflects the filtered list.
  Native plugins ship one binary per platform inside the zip and use a
  platform-neutral manifest `entry` (bare library name); the native
  backend resolves it to `lib<entry>.so` (Unix) or `<entry>.dll`
  (Windows). An explicit filename entry (`*.so`/`*.dll`) still works
  as before.
- The dialog records the feed URL as the plugin's *source* (来源/Source)
  in `meta.json` at install time (`"file"` for install-from-file).

Default feed URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aron566/BPLC_Plugin_Market/main/market.json`.
Override for dev/test: env var `BPLC_MARKET_FEED_URL` (supports `file://`).

## Plugin settings

`plugin.json` may declare a `"settings"` array; the dialog generates a
*Settings* tab form from it and persists values to
`<plugin-dir>/settings.json`. Scripts read them via
`host.getSetting(key, default)` (see `HOST_API.md`).

```json
"settings": [
  {"key": "max_nodes", "type": "integer", "default": 200,
   "minimum": 10, "maximum": 2000,
   "title": "最大节点数", "title_en": "Max nodes",
   "description": "...", "description_en": "..."},
  {"key": "show_labels", "type": "boolean", "default": true,
   "title": "显示节点标签", "title_en": "Show node labels"},
  {"key": "layout", "type": "string", "enum": ["auto", "circular", "grid"],
   "default": "auto", "title": "布局方式", "title_en": "Layout"}
]
```

- `type`: `boolean` | `integer` | `number` | `string`;
  `type: string` + `"enum"` renders a drop-down.
- Unknown types or entries without `key` are skipped by the manifest
  parser.

## Common environment variables

The host exposes a fixed set of environment variables to every script
plugin via `host.getEnv(name)` (see `HOST_API.md` §2); the dialog's
*Environment* tab lists them with live values. Defined in
`plugin_api/plugin_env.h`: `BPLC_APP_VERSION`, `BPLC_API_VERSION`,
`BPLC_PLUGIN_DIR`, `BPLC_DATA_DIR`, `BPLC_LANG`.

## Package format

A plugin package is a zip containing at minimum:

```
plugin.json   # manifest, see plugin_api/plugin_manifest.h
<entry>       # entry script named by manifest "entry"
```

## Install flow

1. Market install: download zip → verify **sha256** against the feed value
   (mismatch = rejected) → unzip to temp dir → validate `plugin.json`
   (manifest + entry file must exist) → check `min_app_version` against the
   running app version → check `platforms` against the running platform
   → copy to the install dir.
2. Offline install (`Install from file...`): same chain minus sha256
   (no feed to compare against) — manifest validity and entry-file
   existence are still enforced.
3. Zip-slip guard: entries with absolute paths or `..` are rejected.

Install dir: `QStandardPaths::AppDataLocation + "/plugins/<name>/"`.
Each installed plugin gets `meta.json`: `{ "enabled": bool, "installed_at" }`.
Re-installing the same name replaces it (= update). `uninstall(name)`
deletes the dir; name is restricted to a single path segment
(`..`, `/`, `\` rejected).

## Enable / disable

`meta.json` `enabled=false` plugins are silently skipped by
`PluginWorker::start_load` (no error panel). Toggling in the dialog takes
effect after plugins are reloaded (dialog close triggers a reload of all
plugin dirs).

## Native (C++) plugin ABI compatibility

Native (C++) plugins are compiled binaries linked against a specific Qt
version + compiler toolchain. Their binary ABI must match the host app's;
a mismatch (plugin built with a different Qt version, or MSVC vs MinGW)
corrupts the QMetaObject layout and **crashes the host on load**.

Each native plugin declares its ABI in `plugin.json`, either as a single
string (single-platform package) or per-platform (multi-platform package):

    "abi": {
        "windows-x86_64": "qt6-mingw-x64",
        "linux-x86_64": "qt6-gcc-x64"
    }

The host computes its own ABI at startup as `qt<major>-<compiler>-<arch>`
(`plugin_host_abi()` in `plugin_api/plugin_manifest.h`; compiler is
`msvc`/`mingw`/`gcc`/`clang` — note Linux GCC reports `gcc`, not `mingw`;
Qt 6.x ABI is stable, so only the major version is checked — 6.10 and 6.11
are compatible) and filters native plugins whose `abi` is missing or differs —
marked incompatible in the market and skipped at load. The market feed carries
the same per-version `abi`; `update_market_json.py` copies it from the
package's `plugin.json`, and the packager (`make_packages.sh`) injects the
build's ABI at package time. Script plugins (js/lua) are ABI-independent
and need no `abi` field.

## Verification chain (current)

- sha256 of the downloaded package vs the feed (market installs).
- Manifest + entry-file validation for every install.
- `min_app_version` compatibility check before market installs.
- `platforms` compatibility check before market installs.

**Not yet implemented:** Ed25519 official-signature verification of
packages (per the plugin-system interface draft). The feed and the
transport are not trusted; the local checks above are the trust anchor
for now. Signature verification is the next step before shipping
non-test plugins.

## API notes

- `PluginMarket` lives on the GUI thread; downloads are async via
  `QNetworkAccessManager` (`feed_ready`/`feed_error`,
  `install_progress`/`install_finished`).
- Static helpers (`parse_feed`, `verify_sha256`, `unzip_to_dir`,
  `compare_version`, `app_version_ok`) are unit-testable without a GUI.
- The main window loads plugin dirs in order: CLI `--plugins-dir`
  (or `<app>/plugins`) first, then the market install dir. Same plugin
  name in both: the later load wins (worker map keyed by manifest name).
